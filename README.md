### Bad UI Analysis and Design Proposal
####   #Not Identified as formal site of goverment

First impression when we look this website ,particularly in it's bar ,we never expect that this is formal website 
under goverment maintenance .At the least in the formal websites of goverment ,there are consist official logo of institution.

`Need institution logo in header or footer ,moreover name of institution that responsible for it`

#### #Waste Navigation Menu
![Musrenbang 2019](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hci-a-if-its-2019/assignment-0-rahmsofyan/master/Assigment%200/%231%20Musrenbang/%231bad2.PNG)

Two navigation menu that have same functions,in sidebar and on top table,make it waste and excessive. 

`Enough one navigation menu ,it's better placed in sidebar.`

#### #A lot of row in one table 
![Musrenbang 2019](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hci-a-if-its-2019/assignment-0-rahmsofyan/master/Assigment%200/%231%20Musrenbang/%231bad3.1.PNG)

Main feature in this website is display proposal data,display all data in one view make it too exhausted.
In addtion, users will make many scrolling to catch their data. Another bad,data in row "plaffon anggaran" and "satuan"
display in button mode,give the effect "want to clicking", but it will not effect ,maybe it for users concer .

`Give Searching feature in top table, make light to catch their data.
Make two page for separate between "Fisik" and  "Non-fisik" table ,and Need a paging system to manage every table. 
Change button mode which state before to ordinary text with bold type, it can make concern for users.`

#### #Not Appropirate relation

In Navigation Menu,"Rekap Musrenbang" button,there no appropriate relation between icon and it's menu button name. "Rekap Musrenbang" means "Musrenbang" recapitulation ,is close meaning to collection ,but its icon is close meaning to conversation.

Almost same case before,there no appropriate relation between menu button name and what page talking about. "Kamus Usulan" means proposal dictionary,is maybe close meaning to how proposal will explained,but the page concern is for searching proposal with filter.

`give appropriate icon for menu name section, and name for page.`

#### # Admin Login in public purpose

When arrive in home page users will welcome by greeting from institution and login menu for admin.

`Need separate page between public users and admin user. Public users are most number than admin user,so public must presidence over.Moreover login menu for admin placed in different website for public use.`

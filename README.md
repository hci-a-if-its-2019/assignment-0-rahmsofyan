Analysis : 3 Bad Design UI Examples
******* 
## 1.Musrenbang2019

[bappeko.surabaya.go.id/musrenbang2019](bappeko.surabaya.go.id/musrenbang2019)
### Description
Musrenbang2019 ,site which display list subimitted proposal for development planning discussion by
City Goverment of Surabaya ,and maintance by this local institution.
Proposals which will discuss in that forum is from surabaya people. They can watching over about all proposals that had been submitted to goverment , and keep their eye upon their proposal actualization.
Main of this site is display proposals in tables that consist of no,name of proposals "usulan fisik/non fisik" ,budget "Plafon Anggaran", unit "satuan". Another feature is administator's feature which can only access by their institution  team.
### Bad UI Analysis and Design Proposal
####   #Not Identified as formal site of goverment
![Musrenbang 2019](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hci-a-if-its-2019/assignment-0-rahmsofyan/master/Assigment%200/%231%20Musrenbang/%231bad1.PNG)
First impression when we look this website ,particularly in it's bar ,we never expect that this is formal website 
under goverment maintenance .At the least in the formal websites of goverment ,there are consist official logo of institution.

`Need institution logo in header or footer ,moreover name of institution that responsible for it`

#### #Waste Navigation Menu
![Musrenbang 2019](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hci-a-if-its-2019/assignment-0-rahmsofyan/master/Assigment%200/%231%20Musrenbang/%231bad2.PNG)

Two navigation menu that have same functions,in sidebar and on top table,make it waste and excessive. 

`Enough one navigation menu ,it's better placed in sidebar.`

#### #A lot of row in one table 
![Musrenbang 2019](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hci-a-if-its-2019/assignment-0-rahmsofyan/master/Assigment%200/%231%20Musrenbang/%231bad3.1.PNG)
![Musrenbang 2019](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hci-a-if-its-2019/assignment-0-rahmsofyan/master/Assigment%200/%231%20Musrenbang/%231bad3.3.PNG)

Main feature in this website is display proposal data,display all data in one view make it too exhausted.
In addtion, users will make many scrolling to catch their data. Another bad,data in row "plaffon anggaran" and "satuan"
display in button mode,give the effect "want to clicking", but it will not effect ,maybe it for users concer .

`Give Searching feature in top table, make light to catch their data.
Make two page for separate between "Fisik" and  "Non-fisik" table ,and Need a paging system to manage every table. 
Change button mode which state before to ordinary text with bold type, it can make concern for users.`

#### #Not Appropirate relation
![Musrenbang 2019](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hci-a-if-its-2019/assignment-0-rahmsofyan/master/Assigment%200/%231%20Musrenbang/%231bad4.1.PNG)
![Musrenbang 2019](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hci-a-if-its-2019/assignment-0-rahmsofyan/master/Assigment%200/%231%20Musrenbang/%231bad4.PNG)

In Navigation Menu,"Rekap Musrenbang" button,there no appropriate relation between icon and it's menu button name. "Rekap Musrenbang" means "Musrenbang" recapitulation ,is close meaning to collection ,but its icon is close meaning to conversation.

Almost same case before,there no appropriate relation between menu button name and what page talking about. "Kamus Usulan" means proposal dictionary,is maybe close meaning to how proposal will explained,but the page concern is for searching proposal with filter.

`give appropriate icon for menu name section, and name for page.`

#### # Admin Login in public purpose
![Musrenbang 2019](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hci-a-if-its-2019/assignment-0-rahmsofyan/master/Assigment%200/%231%20Musrenbang/%231bad5.PNG)
When arrive in home page users will welcome by greeting from institution and login menu for admin.

`Need separate page between public users and admin user. Public users are most number than admin user,so public must presidence over.Moreover login menu for admin placed in different website for public use.`

## 2.Pencatatan Pindah Keluar WNI

### Description
![Dispenduk](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hci-a-if-its-2019/assignment-0-rahmsofyan/master/Assigment%200/%232%20Dispenduk/%232main.PNG)
Pencatatan Pindah Keluar WNI is site that provides application service for changing citizenship ,
maintenance by city goverment of Surabaya. Application service is implemented in two features,
register for changing citizenship ,and modify registered application.Addition feature ,site can print registered proof.
### Bad UI Analysis and Design Proposal
#### #Not look formal as formal institutin website
![Dispenduk](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hci-a-if-its-2019/assignment-0-rahmsofyan/master/Assigment%200/%232%20Dispenduk/%232main.PNG)
When arrive in landing page,and focus in headbar ,we can see title
of website with blue background,so we know what purpose of this website,and there name of institution in bottom of,that identified what institution which responsible. Tittle and name of institution is good enough to give information about what site for and who have, but it's not good enough to trust that this site is maintenance by goverment.

`need logo of instituion which responsible`

#### #Dispute between menu and headbar color
headbar color is blue,whereas menu color is brown ,two diffences color is not good enough to combinate in users view and too contrast.

`Change Headbar color and menu color to same color,or make minimum differences between them ,example : blue sky, and blue see.`

#### #Number of registered data in menu
![Dispenduk number](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hci-a-if-its-2019/assignment-0-rahmsofyan/master/Assigment%200/%232%20Dispenduk/%232bad1.PNG)

Placed number of registered in menu with same color too,make it users think 
that it's part of menu,and triggered users to try click but no effect happen.

`Place number of registered in difference place with menu ,place in top of menu with few space between them is good 
enough,this solution if insitituion want to display every time. It's best if just located in landing page ,so useers just see
one time ,at they first arrive.`

#### #One place for register form ,and  its result
![Dispenduk twin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hci-a-if-its-2019/assignment-0-rahmsofyan/master/Assigment%200/%232%20Dispenduk/%232bad2.PNG)
Possibility,after success register, data will collect in table 
bottom of registration form. It feel not too comfort to see table below of,
bacuse table seem as form,but it's not.

And button "simpan" in bottom of data collection table have grey almost black color such had clicked. 


`change table of registered data into simple form like as a box that only have important data display to indicate what data is,
and data will added after success registered,give edit function if user want to modify their data any time. Change color of button "simpan" to bright color ,like grey almost white.`

## 3. Ehealth Surabaya
### Link
[ehealth.surabaya.go.id](https://ehealth.surabaya.go.id)
### Description
Ehealth is website that maintenance by city Goverment of Surabaya,
it give online registration service for public that stay in Surabaya.The interasing thing from this website is provides 3
language : Indonesia,Jawa,and Madura ,furthermore it give voice for user guidelines in 3 language ,like calling customer
service,it's creative idea.

### Bad UI Analysis and Design Proposal
#### #Welcoming by to select language
When arrive in landing page,Firstly users must select language to choose how service will accompany.
How important a language in city that majority people had known about national language,it's not enough good
to give language option in landing page.Except if in Surabaya City there are tight difference,particularly in language use in society.But 3 language feature is still good idea,its craetive idea to make public feel fun.

`Landing page must give genaral information about this website,
or guidelines how to users use it or straight to purpose.
Language option can attach in side or bottom website,that viewable for users.`

#### #Voice cannot mute or stop
It's is creative idea to make guidelines as voice,Voice will play when users enter new page.Users that often use site can easily
to get what they need,no need again guidelines, voice will annoy users if it speaker cannot be stop or mute.

`add mute and stop button to pause voice.`

#### #Step to Registration,from difference to same option
After select language, users will direct to new page that give options  to select "Rumah Sakit" or puskesmas,after that users 
will direct again to select where is place ("Rumah sakit" or "Puskesmas" that had selected before) locations among few of
them,until the page that give same option despite difference selected before.It will cause many branch of page,effect in hight
resource cost ,and users will start from first page if they not intentionly take wrong choice.

`Make step registration from same option to difference option.`

#### #Difficult when want back
Path directory in top of option had no effect when clicked ,and "kembali" button attached in top of option make it not viewable 
by users.

`Make a back function to back in previous page in path directory.And place "kembali" button in viewable space ,it's better in 
left side of website.`

#### #Print queue ticket and Cencel queue in last registration page
If Users want to print ticket or cencel their queue ,they must enter registration mechanism to reach last page of registration,
to get that feature,it's not structured and will make difficult user.

`Move print queue ticket and cencel queue to landing page together registration feature.`

#### #Input what queue data
When users want to print ticket or cencel queue they must find their data first. Maybe, the right title is not "cari data antrian" but "masukan nomer antrian" ,"cari" close means to search somethings missing, but there is no missing,users have their data. And "data antrian"/queue data is too general, is not exactly what need to insert.

`Change "Cari" to "Input" ,it's maybe more proper meaning. And "Data" to "nomer or id" that exact meaning to make users ligt catch what site intention.`
